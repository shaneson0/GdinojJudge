== Streams

Placeholder chapter.

Streams are a new feature in Cowboy 2.0 that requires
a little more tweaking before they can be generally
useful. This chapter will be made available in a future
pre-release.

Streams are meant to replace hooks. The relevant chapters
for Cowboy 1.0 were:

* xref:hooks[Hooks]
* xref:broken_clients[Dealing with broken clients]
