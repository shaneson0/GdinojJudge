%% @todo To optimize the number of active timers we could have a command
%% that enables a timeout that is called in the absence of any other call,
%% similar to what gen_server does. However the nice thing about this is
%% that the connection process can keep a single timer around (the same
%% one that would be used to detect half-closed sockets) and use this
%% timer and other events to trigger the timeout in streams at their
%% intended time.
%%
%% This same timer can be used to try and send PING frames to help detect
%% that the connection is indeed unresponsive.
